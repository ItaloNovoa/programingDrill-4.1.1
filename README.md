# programingDrill-4.1.1

Write a program that simulates the first quantum system described
in this section. The user should be able to specify how many points the particle
can occupy (warning: keep the max number low, or you will fairly quickly run out of
memory). The user will also specify a ket state vector by assigning its amplitudes.
The program, when asked the likelihood of finding the particle at a given point, will
perform the calculations described in Example 4.1.1. If the user enters two kets, the
system will calculate the probability of transitioning from the first ket to the second,
after an observation has been made.
